# TenaciousRaidTools
Tools to help raiders by the top* guild on Thrall-US

This addon has some very useful and important functionality to support the raiding public.  For years we've kept this secret within our guild to give ourselves a substantial competitive advantage, but with Season 3 on the horizon, the time has come to spread this knowledge

To open TRT, type /trt, /tenaciousraidtools, or open the crafting orders UI

Features:
- Send work orders for treatises with a single click
- Post work orders to your guild to help with crafting quests
- Use DPS meter data from Details to display estimates of how long it will take to kill mobs in their tooltips (it assumes the mob will get 1/5th of your group's overall DPS from the current pull or overall data, and the full group's DPS from the last boss encounter)
